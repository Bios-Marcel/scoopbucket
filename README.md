# Personal Scoop Bucket

This is an extra bucket for scoop. It contains my own software.

Currently it has a dependencies on the official `extras` bucket, as it needs
some of its scripts for the `post_install` and `pre_uninstall` steps.

Add buckets:

```ps1
scoop bucket add extras
scoop bucket add biosmarcel https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/scoopbucket.git
```
